!write down the list of aspic models being NON MINIMALLY coupled to
!gravity for which you want the reheating energies to be computed in
!the JORDAN FRAME.
!  
!All models non-appearing here will be assumed to be minimally
!coupled. If a non-minimally coupled model is not listed here, its
!energie density of reheating will still be computed but in the
!Einstein Frame.
