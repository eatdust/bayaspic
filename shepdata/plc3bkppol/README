Data are:
TTTEEE+lowE (plikHM) + BK15 + lensing

Shepard trained with 300 control points and 600 fitted points, using data from
a marginalized posterior binned with 14x14x14x14.

NB: lowl is *not used* as it induces a running (eps3) inconsistent with slow-roll, which is not seen in lowE. These data slightly prefer non-vanishing primordial GWs.
